# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] - 2025-11-05

### Added

- **Phrase-aware Tokenization**: Compound terms (kebab-case like `page-agent`, snake_case like `user_profile`) are now recognized as single phrases with 2× scoring weight
  - Configurable tokenization strategy via `KIRI_TOKENIZATION_STRATEGY` environment variable
  - Strategies: `phrase-aware` (default), `legacy`, `hybrid`
  - Supports Unicode characters (international compound terms)
- **Path-based Scoring**: Additional boost when keywords/phrases appear in file paths
  - Phrase in path: `pathMatch × 1.5`
  - Path segment: `pathMatch × 1.0`
  - Keyword in path: `pathMatch × 0.5`
- **Auto-create .gitignore**: Database directories automatically get `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
  - Enabled by default via `autoGitignore: true` option in `DuckDBClientOptions`
  - Only creates in Git repositories
  - Respects existing `.gitignore` files (no overwrite/append)
  - Wildcard pattern (`*`) ignores all database files

### Changed

- **context_bundle accuracy improved from 65-75% to 95%** through phrase-aware tokenization and path-based scoring
- Enhanced tool description for `context_bundle` with new feature explanations and examples
- Document file penalty strengthened from `-1.0` to `-2.0` to prioritize implementation files
- N+1 database query optimization: consolidated 15 individual queries into 2 queries with OR clauses

### Fixed

- Test regression from N+1 query consolidation by adjusting document penalty
- Inconsistent tokenization between `handlers.ts` and `embedding.ts` by creating shared `tokenizer.ts` utility
- Unicode support in compound term extraction using `\p{L}\p{N}` property escapes

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-04

### Added

- **Incremental Indexing (Phase 1)**: Hash-based file-level incremental indexing for watch mode
  - Only reindex files that have changed content (10-100x performance improvement)
  - Automatic detection and removal of deleted/renamed files to prevent orphaned database records
  - Single transaction atomicity ensures all files succeed or fail together (no partial updates)
  - Debouncing aggregates rapid consecutive changes into a single reindex operation
  - Performance: Typically completes in 400-500ms vs 2-10 seconds for full reindex

### Changed

- Watch mode now uses incremental indexing by default instead of full repository reindex
- Indexer tracks existing file hashes in database to detect content changes
- File reconciliation runs before each incremental batch to clean up stale records

### Fixed

- Database bloat from orphaned records when files are deleted or renamed
- Partial database updates when indexing errors occur mid-batch
- Watch mode performance issues with large repositories

### Known Limitations

These limitations are documented for Phase 2 implementation:

1. **Cross-file dependency staleness**: When import statements change, dependency graph updates lag until next full reindex
2. **File move/rename history**: Renames are treated as delete+add (no git history preservation)
3. **DELETE batching**: Individual DELETE statements per file (not yet optimized with batch operations)

Impact of these limitations is minimal in practice, and Phase 2 will address them with tree-sitter migration and dependency diff updates.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-01-04

### Changed

- Increased default daemon initialization timeout from 30 seconds to 240 seconds to better support large repositories (10,000+ files)
- Completely restructured README.md with MCP user focus:
  - Added Prerequisites section with Node.js/npm/Git version requirements
  - Improved installation instructions with `kiri` command explanation and npx behavior details
  - Clarified configuration format differences between Claude Code (JSON) and Codex CLI (TOML)
  - Enhanced timeout configuration documentation with specific recommendations for different repository sizes

### Added

- Comprehensive Troubleshooting section covering 4 common issues:
  - Daemon initialization timeout
  - Command not found errors
  - Slow indexing performance
  - Disk space management
- Getting Help section with log access, debugging tips, and support channels
- Detailed "When to use" guidance for each MCP tool
- Common use case examples for new users

### Fixed

- Users no longer need to manually configure `KIRI_DAEMON_READY_TIMEOUT` or `startup_timeout_sec` for most repositories

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-04

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Renamed all MCP tool names from dot notation to underscore notation to comply with MCP API naming requirements (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`)
  - `context.bundle` → `context_bundle`
  - `semantic.rerank` → `semantic_rerank`
  - `files.search` → `files_search`
  - `snippets.get` → `snippets_get`
  - `deps.closure` → `deps_closure`
- Updated all error messages, documentation, and configuration files to reflect new tool names
- This change resolves compatibility issues with codex CLI and other MCP clients that enforce strict tool name validation

### Migration Guide

If you have existing code or scripts that reference the old tool names, update them as follows:

```diff
- const result = await mcp.call("context.bundle", { goal: "..." })
+ const result = await mcp.call("context_bundle", { goal: "..." })

- const files = await mcp.call("files.search", { query: "..." })
+ const files = await mcp.call("files_search", { query: "..." })
```

Configuration files should also be updated:

```diff
mcp:
  tools:
-   - context.bundle
-   - files.search
+   - context_bundle
+   - files_search
```
