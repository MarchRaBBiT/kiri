# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.0] - 2025-11-05

### Fixed

- **`boost_profile="docs"` now correctly includes files from `docs/` directory**
  - **Previous issue**: `docs/` directory was unconditionally blacklisted (score = -100), even when using `boost_profile: "docs"`
  - **Root cause**: Blacklist check occurred before boost_profile logic with early return, preventing multipliers from ever being applied
  - **Solution**: Skip `docs/` blacklist entry when `profile="docs"`, allowing documentation files to be ranked normally
  - **Impact**: Documentation-focused searches now work as originally intended (CHANGELOG v0.7.0 claimed this worked but it didn't)
  - **Backward compatibility**: Default profile (`boost_profile: "default"`) continues to blacklist `docs/` directory for code-focused queries
  - **Evidence**: Added integration tests to verify both `boost_profile="docs"` (allows `docs/`) and default profile (blacklists `docs/`)

## [0.8.0] - 2025-11-05

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `compact: true` is now the default for `context_bundle`**
  - **Previous behavior**: `compact: false` (default) returned preview field, consuming ~55,000 tokens
  - **New behavior**: `compact: true` (default) omits preview field, consuming ~2,500 tokens (95% reduction)
  - **Impact**: Token consumption reduced by 95% by default, improving cost efficiency and response time
  - **Migration**: If you need code previews immediately, explicitly set `compact: false` in requests
  - **Recommended workflow**: Use `compact: true` (default) for exploration → `snippets.get` for detailed code

- **Config files now receive separate, stronger penalty (95% reduction) from doc files (50% reduction)**
  - **Previous behavior**: Config files (package.json, tsconfig.json) and docs (.md, .yaml) received same 70% penalty
  - **New behavior**:
    - Config files: `×0.05` penalty (95% reduction via `configPenaltyMultiplier`)
    - Doc files: `×0.5` penalty (50% reduction via `docPenaltyMultiplier`)
  - **Impact**: Config files now rarely appear in top 15 results, improving relevance for code-focused queries

### Added

- **`configPenaltyMultiplier` in scoring profiles** (`config/scoring-profiles.yml`)
  - Controls config file penalty (default: 0.05 = 95% reduction)
  - Separate from `docPenaltyMultiplier` to distinguish config files from documentation
  - **Multi-language support**: Covers 12+ programming languages and toolchains
  - **Directory-based detection**: Files in config directories automatically penalized
  - Applied via shared `isConfigFile()` helper function to eliminate code duplication

- **Comprehensive `compact` mode documentation** in `docs/api-and-client.md`
  - English and Japanese bilingual documentation
  - Two-tier workflow examples showing optimal token usage patterns
  - Token comparison table (55K vs 2.5K tokens)
  - Usage guidelines for when to use compact mode vs full preview mode
  - Real-world Lambda function investigation example

- **Runtime warning for breaking change** (`src/server/rpc.ts`)
  - Displays once on first use: "⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE (v0.8.0): compact mode is now default"
  - Guides users to set `compact: false` to restore previous behavior
  - Prevents silent behavior changes that could impact existing workflows

- **Edge case tests** for config file detection (`tests/server/boosting-helpers.spec.ts`)
  - Verifies implementation files in `src/config/` are not penalized
  - Validates multi-language config file detection (Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, Docker, etc.)
  - Ensures paths with config-like segments don't cause false positives
  - Tests non-.lock extension lock files (npm-shrinkwrap.json, Package.resolved, packages.lock.json)
  - Tests directory-based detection (bootstrap/, config/, migrations/, locales/)

### Fixed

- **Config files (package.json, tsconfig.json) no longer dominate search results**
  - Previous issue: Generic config files appeared in top 15 despite being rarely relevant
  - Root cause: Insufficient penalty (70% reduction) allowed config files with keyword matches to rank high
  - Solution: Separate `configPenaltyMultiplier` (95% reduction) applied before doc penalty

- **Code duplication in config file detection**
  - Previous issue: Config patterns defined twice in `applyFileTypeBoost()` and `applyFileTypeMultipliers()`
  - Solution: Extracted to shared constants (`CONFIG_FILES`, `CONFIG_EXTENSIONS`, `CONFIG_PATTERNS`) and `isConfigFile()` helper function
  - Impact: Improved maintainability and consistency across codebase

## [0.7.0] - 2025-11-05

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Multiplicative penalties replace additive penalties** for file type ranking in `context_bundle`
  - Documentation files now receive `×0.3` penalty (70% reduction) instead of `-2.0` additive penalty
  - Implementation files receive `×1.3` boost (30% increase) instead of `+0.5` additive boost
  - **Impact**: Implementation files now rank 5-10× higher than documentation files for code-focused queries
  - **Migration**: For documentation-focused queries, use `boost_profile: "docs"` parameter

### Added

- **Configurable penalty multipliers** in `config/scoring-profiles.yml`
  - `docPenaltyMultiplier`: Controls documentation file penalty (default: 0.3 = 70% reduction)
  - `implBoostMultiplier`: Controls implementation file boost (default: 1.3 = 30% increase)
  - All scoring profiles (default, bugfix, testfail, typeerror, feature) support multipliers
- **Phase 1 conservative rollout**: Starting with 70% penalty (0.3 multiplier) to gather feedback before increasing to 90% (0.1 multiplier)

### Fixed

- **Documentation files no longer dominate implementation-focused searches**
  - Previous issue: Docs with high semantic similarity could outrank actual implementation files
  - Root cause: Additive penalty (-2.0) was insufficient to overcome path match (+2.25) + text match (+2.0) + structural similarity (+0.54)
  - Solution: Multiplicative penalty applied AFTER all additive scoring components
- **boost_profile="docs" now correctly prioritizes documentation** without penalty
  - Safety rule: Profile "docs" skips all documentation penalties
  - Enables doc-focused queries like "setup guide" to return documentation first
- **Negative score inversion prevented**
  - Multipliers only applied to positive scores (score > 0)
  - Blacklisted directories (-100 score) remain heavily penalized

### Technical Details

- New `CandidateInfo.scoreMultiplier` field accumulates boosts/penalties (default: 1.0)
- Multipliers applied in separate phase AFTER `applyStructuralScores()` for predictable behavior
- Path-based scoring remains additive (adds new information, not just file type filtering)
- Test files, lock files, config files keep additive penalties (already very strong at -2.0 to -3.0)

## [0.6.0] - 2025-11-05

### Added

- **Phrase-aware Tokenization**: Compound terms (kebab-case like `page-agent`, snake_case like `user_profile`) are now recognized as single phrases with 2× scoring weight
  - Configurable tokenization strategy via `KIRI_TOKENIZATION_STRATEGY` environment variable
  - Strategies: `phrase-aware` (default), `legacy`, `hybrid`
  - Supports Unicode characters (international compound terms)
- **Path-based Scoring**: Additional boost when keywords/phrases appear in file paths
  - Phrase in path: `pathMatch × 1.5`
  - Path segment: `pathMatch × 1.0`
  - Keyword in path: `pathMatch × 0.5`
- **Auto-create .gitignore**: Database directories automatically get `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
  - Enabled by default via `autoGitignore: true` option in `DuckDBClientOptions`
  - Only creates in Git repositories
  - Respects existing `.gitignore` files (no overwrite/append)
  - Wildcard pattern (`*`) ignores all database files

### Changed

- **context_bundle accuracy improved from 65-75% to 95%** through phrase-aware tokenization and path-based scoring
- Enhanced tool description for `context_bundle` with new feature explanations and examples
- Document file penalty strengthened from `-1.0` to `-2.0` to prioritize implementation files
- N+1 database query optimization: consolidated 15 individual queries into 2 queries with OR clauses

### Fixed

- Test regression from N+1 query consolidation by adjusting document penalty
- Inconsistent tokenization between `handlers.ts` and `embedding.ts` by creating shared `tokenizer.ts` utility
- Unicode support in compound term extraction using `\p{L}\p{N}` property escapes

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-04

### Added

- **Incremental Indexing (Phase 1)**: Hash-based file-level incremental indexing for watch mode
  - Only reindex files that have changed content (10-100x performance improvement)
  - Automatic detection and removal of deleted/renamed files to prevent orphaned database records
  - Single transaction atomicity ensures all files succeed or fail together (no partial updates)
  - Debouncing aggregates rapid consecutive changes into a single reindex operation
  - Performance: Typically completes in 400-500ms vs 2-10 seconds for full reindex

### Changed

- Watch mode now uses incremental indexing by default instead of full repository reindex
- Indexer tracks existing file hashes in database to detect content changes
- File reconciliation runs before each incremental batch to clean up stale records

### Fixed

- Database bloat from orphaned records when files are deleted or renamed
- Partial database updates when indexing errors occur mid-batch
- Watch mode performance issues with large repositories

### Known Limitations

These limitations are documented for Phase 2 implementation:

1. **Cross-file dependency staleness**: When import statements change, dependency graph updates lag until next full reindex
2. **File move/rename history**: Renames are treated as delete+add (no git history preservation)
3. **DELETE batching**: Individual DELETE statements per file (not yet optimized with batch operations)

Impact of these limitations is minimal in practice, and Phase 2 will address them with tree-sitter migration and dependency diff updates.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-01-04

### Changed

- Increased default daemon initialization timeout from 30 seconds to 240 seconds to better support large repositories (10,000+ files)
- Completely restructured README.md with MCP user focus:
  - Added Prerequisites section with Node.js/npm/Git version requirements
  - Improved installation instructions with `kiri` command explanation and npx behavior details
  - Clarified configuration format differences between Claude Code (JSON) and Codex CLI (TOML)
  - Enhanced timeout configuration documentation with specific recommendations for different repository sizes

### Added

- Comprehensive Troubleshooting section covering 4 common issues:
  - Daemon initialization timeout
  - Command not found errors
  - Slow indexing performance
  - Disk space management
- Getting Help section with log access, debugging tips, and support channels
- Detailed "When to use" guidance for each MCP tool
- Common use case examples for new users

### Fixed

- Users no longer need to manually configure `KIRI_DAEMON_READY_TIMEOUT` or `startup_timeout_sec` for most repositories

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-04

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Renamed all MCP tool names from dot notation to underscore notation to comply with MCP API naming requirements (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`)
  - `context.bundle` → `context_bundle`
  - `semantic.rerank` → `semantic_rerank`
  - `files.search` → `files_search`
  - `snippets.get` → `snippets_get`
  - `deps.closure` → `deps_closure`
- Updated all error messages, documentation, and configuration files to reflect new tool names
- This change resolves compatibility issues with codex CLI and other MCP clients that enforce strict tool name validation

### Migration Guide

If you have existing code or scripts that reference the old tool names, update them as follows:

```diff
- const result = await mcp.call("context.bundle", { goal: "..." })
+ const result = await mcp.call("context_bundle", { goal: "..." })

- const files = await mcp.call("files.search", { query: "..." })
+ const files = await mcp.call("files_search", { query: "..." })
```

Configuration files should also be updated:

```diff
mcp:
  tools:
-   - context.bundle
-   - files.search
+   - context_bundle
+   - files_search
```
